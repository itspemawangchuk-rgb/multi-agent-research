# Multi-Agent Research Team

## Overview
This project is part of the GenZ AI Challenge. It demonstrates a multi-agent research system where different AI agents collaborate to solve problems efficiently.

## Objective
To build a scalable multi-agent setup where agents can research, analyze, and combine results into a final output.

## Agents Used
- Research Agent
- Analysis Agent
- Summary Agent

## Technologies
- Python
- GitHub
- AI agent framework
- ## Creative / Unique Feature

### Agent Debate & Consensus Mechanism

Before producing a final research output, multiple agents
independently analyze the same query. A synthesis agent
compares responses and generates a consensus-based answer.
